            My name is InÃªs, born and raised in Porto - Portugal, and I'm a
            designer generalist currently working at Porto4Ageing. As a 90's
            baby, I have a great appreciation for the Internet, I owe part of my
            education to online courses, workshops, youtube tutorials and even
            educational Tiktoks. I also have a Fine Arts BA and I'm currently a
            Multimedia Communication Masterâ€™s student researching on
            Human-Centered design and cocreation processes, for the development
            of a more inclusive, equitable and accessible future. Recently, I've
            been particularly interested in UX design and the value of open
            communication with end-users - considering their story, opinions,
            behaviours, emotions, and gathering insights to problem-solving and
            co-designing solutions. My multidisciplinary education as allowed me
            to explore many fields of study and learn from different people. I
            like to believe that it makes me a more versatile and empathetic
            designer. When I'm not designing, you can find me practicing my
            coding skills, listening to funny podcasts, walking in nature and
            taking selfies with photogenic cows.
