              My name is Inês, born and raised in Porto - Portugal, and I'm a
              designer generalist currently working at

                >Porto4Ageing</a
              >. As a 90's baby, I have a great appreciation for the Internet, I
              owe part of my education to: online courses, workshops, youtube
              tutorials and even Tiktoks. I also have a Fine Arts BA and I'm a
              Multimedia Communication Master’s student researching on
              Human-Centered design and cocreation processes, for the
              development of a more inclusive, equitable and accessible future.
              My multidisciplinary education as allowed me to explore many
              fields of study and learn from different people. I like to believe
              that it makes me a more versatile and empathetic designer. When
              I'm not designing, you can find me practicing my coding skills,
              listening to funny podcasts, walking in nature and taking selfies
              with photogenic cows.
            </p>

              I believe that creative collaboration takes experiences from good
              to GREAT.
